## About
### Home brew tools & recipe builder 
The homebrew tool is a C# console application that can help build home brew recipes for beer and mead. It also can calculate ABV(alcohol by volume), convert Brix to Specfic Gravity, and determine Specfic Gravity from amount and type of malt extract. This app was developed for the software development track of the boot camp <a href="http://codekentucky.org/" target="_blank">Code Kentucky</a> in which I am enrolled.
