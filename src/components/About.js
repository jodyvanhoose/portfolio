      <p>Hello my name is Jody VanHoose. I am a Front End Web Developer who graduated from Code Kentucky Bootcamp. I have always had a passion for working and tinkering with tech. As I am also a Physical Therapist Assistant with many years of experience in healthcare, I bring many other qualifications with me like good oral and written communication, collaboration with interdisciplinary teams, and problem solving. I am currently in a leadership role and work well with other teammates. In addition to my current physical therapy duties I am the unoffical "IT guy" for our facility. I'm excited to learn more and grow as a Front End Web Developer and I can't wait to be a part of your team and help solve tomorrows problems today!</p>
